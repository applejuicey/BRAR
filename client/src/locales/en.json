    "introductionText": "(BRAR) is a Bayesian adaptive design which can make use of accumulated trial data to adjust the allocation probabilities in the next period so that more subjects will be assigned to better treatments.",
    "introductionQuoteText": "If a trial is conducted using adaptive randomisation, the physician may inform the patient in the following somewhat more reasonable way: \"Mm. Fornier, I have two possible treatments for your cancer, A and B, but I do not know which is better. So I would like to enroll you in a clinical trial aimed at comparing these treatments to each other. If you agree to enter the trial, your treatment will be chosen randomly by a computer, based on the data that we have so far on how well these two treatments have done with previous patients in the trial\"",
